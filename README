A simple thread pool allowing scheduling of jobs in a "fair" way. Jobs are
enqueued in the pool associated to a tag. To pick a job to run, the threads
in the pool cycle through the tags in round robin. Thus you're guaranted
that jobs associated to a tag are never blocked by a bunch jobs associated to
another tag: the pool will alternate between tags when picking jobs from
its queue.

The interface is simple and allows:
	- pushing jobs in the pool and forget them.
	- pushing jobs and wait for completion.
	- pushing jobs and get a result through use of the Future pattern.
	- changing the number of threads in the pool at runtime.
	- multiple thread pools: the FairThreadPool is not a singleton.
