Compiling the project should be done via the FairThreadPool.sln
solution. It should work both with Visual Studio and MonoDevelop.

The FairThreadPoolWithTests.sln compile a test dll requiring NUnit.
NUnit 2.5+ is required and the NUnit dlls are expected to be found
in the 'externals' folder. Though it cannot use Mono(Develop)
provided NUnit libraries (they ship 2.4.8), MonoDevelop is still
able to run the tests fine within its integrated interface.
